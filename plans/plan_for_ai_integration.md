# Plan for AI Integration Phase

## Overview
Transform the hello world analysis flow into a real AI-driven supply chain analysis system.

## Phase 2 Goals
- Replace mock responses with real AI analysis
- Implement carbon footprint calculations  
- Add data visualizations
- Create intelligent clarification system

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. AI Service Integration
**Goal**: Connect backend to OpenAI/Anthropic for real analysis

#### Backend Tasks:
- [ ] Add AI service configuration to settings
- [ ] Create AI client service class  
- [ ] Implement supply chain analysis prompts
- [ ] Add error handling and retries
- [ ] Test AI responses for consistency

#### Files to modify:
- `backend/src/implodesc/core/config.py` - Add AI API key settings
- `backend/src/implodesc/services/ai_service.py` - New AI client
- `backend/src/implodesc/services/analysis_service.py` - Analysis logic
- `backend/src/implodesc/api/routes/analysis.py` - Connect to AI service

### 2. Supply Chain Analysis Engine
**Goal**: Generate real supply chain breakdowns

#### Analysis Features:
- [ ] Product categorization and material identification
- [ ] Manufacturing process analysis
- [ ] Transportation and logistics mapping
- [ ] Geographic supply chain mapping
- [ ] Risk assessment and alternative sourcing

#### Data Structures:
- [ ] Supply chain nodes (materials, processes, locations)
- [ ] Process flows and dependencies
- [ ] Transportation modes and distances
- [ ] Company/supplier identification

### 3. Carbon Footprint Calculator
**Goal**: Real environmental impact calculations

#### Carbon Calculation Features:
- [ ] Material-based emission factors
- [ ] Process-based emissions (manufacturing, energy)
- [ ] Transportation emissions (mode, distance)
- [ ] Packaging and end-of-life impacts
- [ ] Regional electricity grid factors

#### Implementation:
- [ ] Use shared carbon_models.py schemas
- [ ] Integrate emission factor databases
- [ ] Calculate scope 1, 2, 3 emissions
- [ ] Uncertainty analysis and ranges

### 4. Data Visualization Components
**Goal**: Interactive charts and diagrams

#### Frontend Visualization:
- [ ] Supply chain flow diagram (D3.js/React Flow)
- [ ] Carbon footprint breakdown charts (Recharts)
- [ ] Geographic supply chain map
- [ ] Process timeline visualization
- [ ] Comparison charts (alternatives, benchmarks)

#### Files to create:
- `frontend/src/components/charts/SupplyChainFlow.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/CarbonBreakdown.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/GeographicMap.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/visualizations/ProcessTimeline.tsx`

### 5. Enhanced Results Display
**Goal**: Rich, interactive analysis results

#### Results Features:
- [ ] Executive summary with key insights
- [ ] Detailed supply chain breakdown
- [ ] Carbon footprint analysis with breakdowns
- [ ] Risk assessment and recommendations
- [ ] Alternative sourcing suggestions
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF, CSV, JSON)

### 6. Intelligent Clarification System
**Goal**: AI-driven follow-up questions

#### Smart Clarifications:
- [ ] Context-aware question generation
- [ ] Progressive disclosure based on responses
- [ ] Industry-specific clarifications
- [ ] Quality and specification deep-dives
- [ ] Regional preference handling

## Implementation Order

### Week 1: AI Foundation
1. Set up AI API integration
2. Create basic supply chain analysis service
3. Replace mock analysis endpoint with real AI

### Week 2: Carbon Calculations
1. Implement carbon footprint calculator
2. Add emission factor databases
3. Create carbon calculation service

### Week 3: Visualizations
1. Add supply chain flow diagrams
2. Implement carbon breakdown charts
3. Create interactive results display

### Week 4: Enhancement & Polish
1. Enhance clarification system with AI
2. Add export functionality
3. Performance optimization and testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can analyze real products (e.g., "cotton t-shirt") and get meaningful supply chain breakdown
- [ ] Carbon footprint calculations return realistic values with proper breakdowns
- [ ] Interactive visualizations clearly show supply chain flow and environmental impact
- [ ] Clarification questions are contextually relevant and improve analysis quality
- [ ] Results can be exported in multiple formats
- [ ] System handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for AI service integration
- [ ] Integration tests for analysis pipeline
- [ ] Frontend component tests for visualizations
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete analysis flow
- [ ] Performance tests for large supply chains

## Technical Considerations
- **AI Costs**: Monitor token usage and implement caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle AI API rate limits gracefully
- **Data Quality**: Validate AI responses and handle inconsistencies
- **Performance**: Cache common analyses and precompute emission factors
- **Scalability**: Design for multiple concurrent analyses

## Environment Setup Needed
- OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Anthropic API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) 
- Consider which AI service to use as primary vs fallback
