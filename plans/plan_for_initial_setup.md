# Plan for Initial Implodesc Setup

## Overview
Create the foundational architecture for Implodesc - an AI-driven supply chain analysis tool.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Initialize backend Python project with FastAPI
  - [x] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies (FastAPI, pydantic, openai, etc.)
  - [x] Create basic FastAPI app structure
  - [x] Set up environment configuration
  - [x] Add health check endpoint

- [x] Initialize frontend Next.js project
  - [x] Create Next.js 14+ app with TypeScript
  - [x] Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
  - [x] Configure basic routing structure
  - [x] Add Clerk authentication setup

- [x] Design shared data schemas
  - [x] Supply chain data models
  - [x] API request/response schemas
  - [x] Carbon footprint calculation models

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
- [ ] Item input and clarification system
  - [ ] Smart input form component
  - [ ] AI-driven clarification flow
  - [ ] Dynamic question generation

- [ ] AI analysis engine
  - [ ] OpenAI/Claude API integration
  - [ ] Supply chain analysis prompts
  - [ ] Data processing pipeline

- [ ] Basic visualization components
  - [ ] Supply chain flow diagram
  - [ ] Carbon footprint charts
  - [ ] Interactive data tables

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Interactive visualizations
  - [ ] D3.js or similar for advanced charts
  - [ ] Interactive supply chain maps
  - [ ] Drill-down capabilities

- [ ] Company/entity database integration
  - [ ] External API integrations
  - [ ] Data enrichment services
  - [ ] Supplier identification

- [ ] Export and sharing functionality
  - [ ] PDF report generation
  - [ ] Data export (CSV, JSON)
  - [ ] Shareable links

## Technical Considerations
- AI rate limiting and cost management
- Data caching strategies for expensive AI calls
- Progressive enhancement for visualizations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Success Criteria
- User can input an item and receive comprehensive analysis
- Interactive clarification flow works smoothly
- Visualizations are engaging and informative
- Performance is acceptable (< 30s for analysis)
- UI is intuitive and visually appealing
