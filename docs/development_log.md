# Implodesc Development Log

This document tracks the detailed development progress of the Implodesc project - an AI-driven supply chain analysis platform.

## Project Overview
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.13, using UV package manager
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types between frontend/backend
- **Goal**: Build a platform for analyzing supply chain carbon footprints using AI

## Development Session: June 9, 2025

### Initial Setup and Environment Configuration

#### Backend Setup
1. **Python Environment Issues**
   - Initial attempt failed: Python 3.10.9 detected, but project requires Python 3.11+
   - Solution: Created virtual environment with Python 3.13.4
   - Command: `uv venv --python python3 && source .venv/bin/activate`

2. **Dependency Installation**
   - Successfully installed 96 packages including FastAPI, uvicorn, pytest, ruff, mypy
   - Key dependencies: FastAPI 0.115.12, uvicorn 0.34.3, pydantic 2.11.5
   - Development tools: pytest, ruff (linting), black (formatting), mypy (type checking)

#### Module Import Issues and Resolution
3. **Shared Module Import Problems**
   - **Issue**: Backend attempting to import `....shared` (relative imports going up 4 levels)
   - **Root Cause**: Shared folder at `/implodesc/shared` but backend trying to import as `src.shared`
   - **Initial Fix Attempt**: Modified imports in `analysis.py` to use absolute path manipulation
   - **Secondary Issue**: Shared modules using relative imports (`.schemas`) causing import errors
   - **Resolution Strategy**: 
     - Temporarily disabled analysis route to isolate issues
     - Fixed health endpoint by creating local HealthResponse class
     - Modified shared module to use absolute imports

#### Server Startup and Testing
4. **Backend Server Status**
   - **Port 8000**: Initially blocked, resolved by killing existing process
   - **Health Endpoint**: Successfully working at `http://localhost:8000/health/`
   - **Response**: `{"status":"healthy","version":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2025-06-09T17:59:59.988444"}`
   - **API Documentation**: Disabled (returns 404) because debug mode is off
   - **Analysis Endpoint**: Temporarily disabled due to import issues

#### Frontend Setup
5. **Node.js Environment**
   - Successfully installed 1003 npm packages
   - Warnings about deprecated packages (inflight, domexception, rimraf, etc.)
   - 5 low severity vulnerabilities detected
   - Husky git hooks installation failed (no .git in subdirectory)

6. **Frontend Server Status**
   - **Port 3000**: Server starts successfully
   - **Issue**: Returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
   - **Next.js Version**: 14.2.29
   - **Startup Time**: Ready in 2.9s
   - **Status**: Needs debugging for 500 error

#### Testing Infrastructure

### Server Startup Issue Resolution (Final Phase)

#### Critical Configuration Issues Resolved
19. **Pydantic Environment Variable Format Issues**
    - **Root Cause**: Pydantic settings expected JSON arrays for list fields, not comma-separated strings
    - **Symptoms**: `ValidationError: Input should be a valid list` and `JSONDecodeError: Expecting value`
    - **Fixed Fields**:
      - `CORS_ORIGINS`: Changed from `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001` to `["http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:3001"]`
      - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Changed from `localhost,127.0.0.1` to `["localhost","127.0.0.1"]`
    - **Debugging Tool**: Created `debug_config.py` to test configuration loading
    - **Status**: Configuration now loads successfully with real OpenAI API key

#### Backend Server Startup Issues Resolved  
20. **Uvicorn Command Line Issues**
    - **Problem**: `uv run uvicorn` would start but die immediately with import errors
    - **Solution**: Use direct Python startup with background process:
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=src nohup python -c "
      from implodesc.main import app
      import uvicorn
      uvicorn.run(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=8001)
      " > server.log 2>&1 &
      ```
    - **Benefits**: More reliable startup, better error logging, background execution
    - **Port Management**: Switched from 8000 to 8001 to avoid conflicts
    - **Logging**: Server logs captured in `server.log` for debugging

#### Real AI Integration Verification

9. **"Nice. now onto the next phase"** (repeated)
   - Continue to next phase

10. **"let's go"**
    - Proceed with work

11. **"great. i want to proceed but i dont think there is anywhere to store the api keys. do we need a separate module for that? or is there a standard way. i'd like it to have the option to store the keys in some kind of local variables or files for personal use, but to offer the ability for someone to submit an api key if they are running it non-locally"**
    - Request for flexible API key management system

12. **"great. I've added my .env with key, for my local use."**
    - Confirmation of local API key setup

13. **"i was running a server on 8000. i've stopped it. start everything again and see if it works. Check my .env file to see that the openai key is in there. i've not changed the anthropic dummy key. how does the system choose which one to use?"**
