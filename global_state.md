# Global State - Implodesc Project

## Project Vision
Implodesc is an AI-driven web interface for comprehensive supply chain analysis. Users input an item and receive:
- Step-by-step supply chain breakdown
- Underlying materials analysis  
- Carbon footprint calculations
- Potential companies/entities involved
- Interactive clarification for scope, quantity, specifications
- Graphically pleasing, interactive visualizations

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete**: Full working development environment with hello world analysis flow.

## What's Been Done
- [x] Created project directory structure:
  - backend/ - Python API for AI processing and data analysis âœ… INITIALIZED
  - frontend/ - TypeScript/React app with interactive UI âœ… INITIALIZED
  - shared/ - Shared types/schemas for supply chain data âœ… COMPLETE
  - docs/ - Project documentation (empty)
  - scripts/ - Deployment/utility scripts (empty)
  - plans/ - Plans for working with Claude Code âœ… ACTIVE
  - .github/workflows/ - CI/CD pipelines (empty)
- [x] Set up CLAUDE.md with development workflow and tech stack guidelines
- [x] Defined project vision and core requirements
- [x] Designed comprehensive data schemas (supply chain, carbon, API)
- [x] Initialized backend FastAPI application with:
  - [x] Complete project structure and dependencies
  - [x] Configuration management with Pydantic Settings
  - [x] Structured logging with structlog
  - [x] Health check endpoints
  - [x] Mock analysis API endpoints
- [x] Initialized frontend Next.js application with:
  - [x] Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and App Router
  - [x] Tailwind CSS with custom design system
  - [x] shadcn/ui component library
  - [x] Clerk authentication with protected routes
  - [x] Basic routing structure (home, analyze, dashboard, auth)
  - [x] React Query for API state management

## Current State âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE
- **Backend**: FastAPI application fully working with health + analysis endpoints
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with complete analysis flow (input â†’ clarifications â†’ results)
- **Testing**: Both backend (66% coverage, 11 tests) and frontend (31% coverage, 11 tests) passing
- **Environment**: Full development setup with Python 3.13, Node.js, uv, npm
- **Integration**: Working end-to-end flow from frontend to backend API
- **Shared schemas**: Implemented with inline schemas (temporary solution)

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 2: AI INTEGRATION PHASE

### Ready to Build
- âœ… Backend server running on port 8000
- âœ… Frontend app running on port 3000  
- âœ… Analysis endpoints functional
- âœ… Test infrastructure in place
- âœ… Development workflow established

### Current Capabilities
- âœ… Product input form with validation
- âœ… Mock clarification questions
- âœ… Session tracking
- âœ… Multi-step UI flow
- âœ… API integration between frontend/backend

### Missing for AI Integration
- **AI API Keys**: OpenAI/Anthropic integration for real analysis
- **Analysis Engine**: Replace mock responses with AI-generated insights
- **Carbon Calculation**: Real emission factor calculations
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and interactive displays

## Core Features Required
1. **Item Input & Clarification**: Smart form with AI-driven clarification questions
2. **Supply Chain Analysis Engine**: AI backend for processing and analysis
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, flow diagrams for supply chain
4. **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Environmental impact analysis
5. **Company/Entity Database**: Identification of potential suppliers/manufacturers
6. **Data Export/Sharing**: Results sharing and export functionality

## Next Steps (PHASE 2 - AI Integration)
1. **Integrate AI Services** - Add OpenAI/Anthropic for real supply chain analysis
2. **Build Analysis Engine** - Replace mock responses with AI-generated supply chain breakdown  
3. **Implement Carbon Calculator** - Real emission factor calculations using shared schemas
4. **Add Data Visualization** - Interactive charts for supply chain flow and carbon impact
5. **Enhanced Clarification Flow** - AI-driven follow-up questions based on initial analysis
6. **Company/Entity Detection** - Identify potential suppliers and manufacturers
7. **Results Export** - PDF/CSV export functionality

## Phase 2 Priority Tasks
- [ ] Set up AI API integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- [ ] Create supply chain analysis service
- [ ] Implement carbon footprint calculations
- [ ] Add data visualization components  
- [ ] Enhance clarification system with AI
- [ ] Build results display with charts
